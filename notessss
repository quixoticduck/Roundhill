top part:
make central
make background same colour as ICB logo (or a gradient) so the logo is part of the background (like in Aloha.com) as a fixed background or position

might have to add a blue bar or a fade to make middle section not look weird



selector {
	property: value;
}

if you have a selector and a space and then another selector you are targetting the child of the first selector

selector child {
	property: value;
}

e.g.

nav a {
	property: value;
}

is only targetting links inside of navs

whereas

nav.menu {
	property: value;
}

is only targetting a nav which also has a class of menu

---

a nav is an element that is inbuilt, not a class or an id


change z index of evertthing other than ICB logo so it scrolls behind

set a transition for the links

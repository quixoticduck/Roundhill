errors:
-when mobile nav menu button has been clicked, if the page resizes from small to large the navbar disappears

mobile nav stays open and fixed when you click on a link

on Chrome Android tablet the navbar or main page sometimes covers only half of width

on first pixel of scroll down the top text is covered

to change:
switch logo to spinning one or make smaller logo a smaller file so it doesnâ€™t need to refocus upon transform
add in Pagelime
make navbar links middle-clickable
make visited links a better color (check on my mobile)
add contact form
restyle mobile nav
change divider asterisk
ICB logo looks silly where it is now on mobile view
